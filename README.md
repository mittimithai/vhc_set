# VHC Set

A variation of the classic card game SET using **Value**, **Hue**, and **Chroma** as card attributes instead of the traditional shape, color, number, and shading.

## About the Game

VHC Set is based on the card game SET, but instead of matching cards based on shape, color, number, and shading, players find sets using:

- **Value** (lightness/darkness of the color)
- **Hue** (the color category)  
- **Chroma** (how bold or pale a color appears)

A valid set consists of three cards where each attribute is either all the same or all different across the three cards.
